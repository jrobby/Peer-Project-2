<!-- Peer Challenge

Create an array with everyone in the cohort as a different index within the array,
Example,
-->

<!--
Have a 'create' button loaded on the DOM when the app loads.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<!--Links-->
		<link rel='stylesheet' href='Perprograming2.css'>

		<!-- Scripts-->
		<!--This order is important to load correctly or else '$' won't be defined -->
		<script type="text/javascript" src ='jquery.min.js' ></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src ='Perprograming2.js'></script>
		
	</head>

	<body>
		<div id='container'></div>
		<div>
			<button>Reload</button>
			
		</div>
		

	</body>

</html>

<!--
Each time the button is clicked, reveal 1 person from the array. 

-->

<!--
Each time you click the button, you should reveal the next person in the array.
That person should be revealed via a slideDown animation.

		$("button").click(function(){
    		$("p").slideDown();
		});


In addition to that person's name, also include a remove button.

		$("#div1").remove();



Clicking on the remove button should fire off an animation that makes the person's name fade out (in addition to the button that was clicked).


		$("button").click(function(){
    		$("p").fadeOut();
		});




If you click the 'create' button enough times, you will exhaust the list of people in it (basically, you get to the end of the array).


When this happens, remove EVERYONE from the DOM, and start the experience over.
					

					reload()





HARD MODE
Have people appear in a 'box' that has equal width and height. The person's name should appear in the center of the box. Style however you would like to make the 'box' appear, well, 'box-like'.

PRO MODE
Use .animate to not have the person fade out completely, but down to 5%. Clicking on the button again should restore the full opacity of that person.

Good luck and have fun!
